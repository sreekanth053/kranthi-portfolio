                            As a web developer, I create dynamic and functional websites using a
                            combination of front-end and back-end technologies. I specialize in building responsive,
                            user-friendly interfaces that enhance the user experience. Whether it’s
                            an e-commerce site, a blog, or a custom web application, I bring ideas to life through code.

                            UI (User Interface) development focuses on creating the visual elements of a website or application.
                            I specialize in turning design mockups into interactive interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                            My goal is to ensure that users have a
                            seamless and enjoyable experience while interacting with your product.

                            UI design is all about aesthetics and usability. As a UI designer,
                            I craft visually appealing layouts, choose color schemes, and create intuitive navigation. I pay attention to details like typography,
                            spacing, and consistency. My designs aim to enhance the overall look and
                            feel of your digital product.
